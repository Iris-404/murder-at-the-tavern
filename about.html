        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            We, Alondra and Iris, created this podcast to have somewhere to tell all the fantasy stories that we have. That is how 
            this short series podcast produced by two undergraduate students with an interest in fantasy came to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            We decided to make this podcast because we wanted to have a place to relax and share our story with others. We decided 
            to make something that people can find interesting to do in their free time. We chose this topic because we were always 
            interested in fantasy. We wanted to introduce more people to the world of fantasy where you can let your imagination 
            run wild and have a bit of fun.

                    Alonda’s introduction was by hearing folktales by the elderly people and from visiting the library and 
                    reading fantasy books. She’s used to hearing a story being told and that even a change of pace can build 
                    suspense in a story.

                    Iris’ first conscious introduction to the world of fantasy was when she started reading books about vampires.
                     After that she quickly became more interested in fantasy and is now able to tell her own stories.
